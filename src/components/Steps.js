              <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cream butter, sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed for
                about 2 minutes.
          
                Add eggs, vanilla and lemon juice, blending with mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then medium speed for about 2
                minutes, or until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl.
          
                With mixer on low speed, add flour, oats, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, blending for about 45 seconds. Don’t
                overmix.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Step2: </strong> Remove bowl from mixer and stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.
          
                Portion dough with a scoop (about 3 tablespoons) onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper about 2 inches
                apart.
          
                Preheat oven to 300°F. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and center is still soft. </p>
          
              <p><strong>Step3:</strong>Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet for about 1 hour.
          
                Cook’s note: You can freeze the unbaked cookies, and there’s no need to thaw. Preheat oven to 300°F and place
                frozen cookies on parchment paper-lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden brown and
                center is still soft.</p>
